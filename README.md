# PROBLEM STATEMENT
**Ken’s Supplies** seeks to deepen its understanding of sales performance across various product subcategories by analyzing key metrics such as sales revenue, profit, and quantity sold. The primary challenge is identifying year-over-year trends and evaluating the contribution of each subcategory to overall business performance.

# MODELLING
I conducted comprehensive data cleaning by using filter functions to eliminate null values and ensuring proper formatting of each column (Date, Text, Number) to support accurate analysis.The data model consists of a main table, **Orders**, which includes fields such as (Row ID, Order ID, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Segment, Postal Code, Product ID, Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit). Additionally, there are sub-tables for **Customers**, linking (customer names and IDs); **Location**, adding details like (postal code, city, state, region, and country) and **Products**, containing (product ID, category, subcategory, and product name). By integrating these tables, we can conduct comprehensive analyses to better understand sales performance at both the product and customer levels.
