# INTRODUCTION
This project focuses on analyzing sales performance across various product categories at **Ken’s Supplies** using advanced analytics tools in Tableau.

Leveraging Tableau’s powerful visualization and analytical capabilities, the project will uncover actionable data-driven strategies to optimize inventory, improve profitability, and enhance decision-making in a competitive market environment.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
**Ken’s Supplies** aims to enhance its understanding of sales performance across various product subcategories by examining critical metrics like sales revenue, profit, and quantity sold. The challenge lies in identifying year-over-year trends and evaluating how each subcategory contributes to the overall business. Without a clear insight into these trends, decision-making around inventory, pricing strategies, and future product investments becomes challenging.
